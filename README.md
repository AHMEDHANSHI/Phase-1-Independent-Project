## General Information
<!-- - Provide general information about your project here.

- Why did you undertake it? -->
Throughout our lifetime, many of us will, at one point, require the help of a medical specialist. At that time, it is essential that you make an informed decision. Before settling on a choice, discuss the possible candidates with your primary healthcare provider. Also, the following are key factors that should influence your decision: 

Will the health professional work in partnership with you?
Is the health professional board-certified?
Is the health professional well-trained and experienced?
Does your health plan provide coverage for this service?
Will the health professional be available when needed?

The aim is  to leverage technology to enhance physical health , mental health and well-being by providing tools, resources, and platforms that promote mindfulness, stress relief, personal growth, and community support.

In today's fast-paced world, people are  looking for ways to get help that concerns  them. However, there are often challenges with finding reliable health platforms that provide easy access to consultations and streamline the booking process for both patient and patients. Many existing platforms are either too complex or lack essential features, such as a simple user interface, secure payment processing, and real-time  availability updates.
